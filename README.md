About Dataset
Context
WLASL is the largest video dataset for Word-Level American Sign Language (ASL) recognition, which features 2,000 common different words in ASL. We hope WLASL will facilitate the research in sign language understanding and eventually benefit the communication between deaf and hearing communities.

Content
The WLASL_v0.3.json file contains the glossary and instances of the videos.

Inside the videos folder, there are about 12k videos each named corresponding video_id.
